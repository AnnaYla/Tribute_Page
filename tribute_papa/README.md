# Tribute_Page
A tribute page to my father, Trifon Oyangoren Sr.
This is my first official project that I pour all I have learned in the pass few months.
My father is the one who inspired me to dream a better life than he had. 
He died to soon and I miss him very much.
This is for you, Pa. I love you so much!
